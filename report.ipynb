    "<h1>SPACEX FIRST STAGE LANDING PREDICTION</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "(Based on capstone project from IBM Data Science Professional Certification)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Executive Summary</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>SpaceX offers competitive pricing for its Falcon 9, only 67 million $ compared to its other providers (more than 150 million dollars each). This advantage price can be obtained by reusing the first stage. Therefore, this projects aim to predict the success rate landing of the first stage base on payload mass, orbit, serial, grid fins, legs, blocks, landing pad (the data is provided on wikipedia and SpaceX API latest launch). We can apply the predicted results and explored data for future rocket launch projects as an instruction, a new provider who want to step into rocket space market, convince investors to invest capital. This report were able to predict the first stage rocket booster landing successfully with an accuracy of 91.57%</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The world of space is coming. Companies are making space travel affordable for everyone: Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights, Rocket Lab provides a small satellite, Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets, SpaceX sends spacecraft to the International Space Station and StarLink to provide satellite Internet access.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>At first, SpaceX’s cost of launching rockets was expensive. However, if the first stage of rocket launches successfully, the cost will decrease with only 67 million dollars, that’s the price of Falcon 9 rocket launches, other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To understand we need to know that: the payload is enclosed in the fairings. Stage two, or the second stage, helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by the first stage and is much larger, more expensive than the second stage. Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash as shown in this clip. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch, this report aims to accurately predict the likelihood of first stage landing. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Methodology</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We collect data from <a href=\"https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API\">SpaceX-API</a> and scraping data from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches\">List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy</a> on Wikipedia by using BeautifulSoup and requests. After collecting, we convert data into data frame and handle missing value, invalid data, turn data types into right format.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Next, we explore data by 3 methods. Firstly, utilize sqlite3 library and using sql magic to do feature analysis and analyze the 2022 launches. Secondly, using seaborn and matplotlib to understand the relationships between features, for example flight number with payload mass, orbit with success rate to help us do feature extraction for further prediction. We also do launch sites analysis by using folium to visualize the location of each launch site on the map and calculate the distance from it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The 2 important features launch sites and payload mass also be showed on python plotly dashboard to enable others explore and manipulate data in an interactive and real-time way.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Finally, we use the sklearn library to standardize and split the data. The data is trained with 4 types models: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree classifier and k nearest neighbors classifier to find the model which has the highest accuracy.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch sites**\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaceX has 3 main launch sites CCSFS SLC-40, total 115 flights, KSC LC-39A, 57 flights, VSFB SLC-4E, 36 flights. Because CCSFS SLC-40 used most for R&D development so this site has high failure rate, the highest success rate was KSC 91.22% (from 2010-2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most ocean landing was in CCSFS (5 flights) success rate 80%, VSFB also has 2 flights, KSC don’t have ocean landing but it has highest success rate of drone ship landing. Almost ground pad landing was success, we only have 1 failure on CCSFS site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because CCSFS SLC-40 is the site has most of launches, it is reasonable that it has various orbit launches which the other sites haven’t tried yet. However, the left 2 sites also have its special, KSC has 1 sub-orbital and VSFB has 1 Heliocentric orbit which CCSFS doesn’t have. When we go deeper, we can observe that though VSFB has fewest launches, but it also has its owns special orbit, almost SSO and PO orbit are from VSFB.\n",
    "\n",
    "From folium visualization, we can see that VAFB launch site is located on the west coast, CCSFS and KSC are near together which are located on the east coast, NASA Johnson Space Center are in the middle of 2 coast, located near Houston, Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "All launch sites are in proximity to equator. This makes sense as it takes less fuel to get into space from the equator due to the physics of Earth's rotation. The launch sites in close proximity to the coast are also logical for safety reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch site are in close proximity to coastline, which can help rocket fly over the ocean during launch, crew also has option to abort launch and attempt water landing, and finally minimize the risk from falling debris. Also launch site need to near the railway and highway which allows easily transport for heavy cargo and property, but it is far from city to restrict the danger of launching rockets to population dense areas\n",
    "\n",
    "**SpaceX customers**\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that top SpaceX customers are NASA, SpaceX, SES and Iridium communications. SES is a Luxembourgish leading satellite telecommunications network provider with over 70 satellites in two different orbits. Iridium operates the Iridium satellite constellation, a system of 66 active satellites and nine in-orbit spares used for worldwide voice and data communication from handheld satellite phones, satellite messenger communication devices and integrated transceivers. About NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research. Most of NASA flights was in CRS projects, it is a contract solution to deliver cargo and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have total 46 flights which are related to NASA, in which NASA(CRS) accounted for the most 26 flights but fewer total payload 71326 kgs, compared to NASA(CTS) 6 flights but total payload is 77050 kgs, average payload mass of each flights of NASA(CRS) is 2743, most of NASA launch was LEO orbit with 70% success rate. It is reasonable because the ISS was in the low earth orbit. Iridium focuses on PO orbit launch with average payload mass is about 9600 kgs, SES focuses on GTO orbits with average payload mass is 4600kgs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Booster version**\n",
    "\n",
    "Falcon 9 has 5 booster version: v1.0, v1.1, FT, Block 4 and Block 5. Block 5 accounted for most of the flights, it is also the most active rockets of SpaceX (152 flights), Block 5 can carried from 325kgs to 17400kgs with high average payload mass 10625kgs and high success rate 94%.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, v1.0 and v1.1 has high failure rate, the first version 100% failure and second version was 80% failure. The latter 2 developed rockets in Falcon 9 family are F9 B4 and F9 FT is better for commercial launches, success rate is 50% and 75% respectively, but still cannot compare with Block 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Booster landing**\n",
    "\n",
    "If booster landing from ocean, it means landing on specific ocean region, usually for gathering test data purpose. Drone ship means land on a drone ship at sea. Ground pad, means land on a ground pad near the launch site. The first success date of ground pad is 2015-12-22 (with B4, B5, FT), drone ship is 2016-04-08 (with B4, B5, FT), ocean is 2014-04-18 (with FT & v1.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orbit**\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaceX focuses on VLEO, GTO, ISS, LEO, PO, SSO, MEO. The highest success rate was VLEO (94.8%), SSO (91.7%), LEO (81.25%). The lowest are GTO (55.9%)\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaceX also has flights from 1-2 with ES-L1, GEO, GEO, TLI and SO.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationships**\n",
    "\n",
    "When flight number increase, first stage tend to land successfully. Most of the flights after 100 are success. However, if payload mass increase the less like the first stage returns. Visualization shows that with payload mass over 8000 kgs, flight launches are divided into 3 launch sites with high success rate, but in below 8000 kgs, flight failure focus on CCSFS\n",
    "\n",
    "In MEO and LEO orbit, the success appears related to number of flights, on the other hand, there seems to be no relationship between flight number when in GTO and VLEO orbit. Heavy payload has negative influence on GTO, positive on LEO and ISS, PO\n",
    "\n",
    "**2022 launches**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, SpaceX executed 60 launches, each month from 4-6 launches, all launches are success, only 2 no attempt status on November for other reasons. Half of the launches was in CCSFS, they also focuses on LEO, SSO, and GTO orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For 4 models, logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, although decision tree has the highest score (94%), but it is overfitting leads to low test score (69%). Therefore, support vector machine appear to be better model which it has high score (92%) and the test score also high (92%)"
